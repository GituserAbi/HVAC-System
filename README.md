# HVAC-System: Heating, Ventilation, and Air conditioning system

# Abstract
To find the optimal balance between electricity demand and production constrained to economic and comfort variables requires intelligent decision and control. This project addresses the formulation of three models that optimize control of a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system in an experimental room, which are coupled with two thermal models of the indoor temperature.

# Models used
Genetic Algorithm (GA)
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
GA with Simulated Annealing 
Wave Water model (WWO)
